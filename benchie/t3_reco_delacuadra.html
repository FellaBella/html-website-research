<h3>Title Three – Recommendations</h3>
<p>
To prevent pipe clogging caused by grease buildup, regular cleaning and maintenance of drainage systems are essential. 
Residential pipes should be cleaned every six months, while pipes in restaurants and other high-grease areas should be cleaned monthly or bi-weekly.
 Installing grease traps in commercial kitchens is highly recommended to intercept grease before it enters the drainage system, and these traps should be cleaned regularly to ensure proper function
