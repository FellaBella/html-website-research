<h2>Hydrodynamic Controls on Nest Site Selection of Janitor
Fish in Marikina River</h2>
<h3>Title One – Statement of the Problem</h3>
<ol>
<li>How do hydrodynamic conditions (flow velocity, water depth, and shear stress) differ
between nest and non-nest areas in the Marikina River?</li>
<li>What bank and substrate characteristics (grain size, cohesion, slope) are associated with nest
site selection??</li>
<li>Can hydrodynamic and physical parameters be used to develop a predictive model for nest
occurrence?</li>
</ol>
