<h2>EVALUATING PIPE CLOGGING CAUSED BYGREASE BUILDUP IN WASTEWATER DRAINAGE SYSTEMS</h2> 
<h3>Title Three – Research Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>The study aims to measure waste accumulation in pipelines and analyze how grease build-up
leads to blockages. It also seeks to identify pipe clogging to develop predictive models for
improved pipe management.</li>
