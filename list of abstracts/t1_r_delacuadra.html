<h2>Hydrodynamic Controls on Nest Site Selection of Janitor
Fish in Marikina River</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Title One – Results</h3>
<p>
The results showed that Janitor fish nests were mostly found in areas with low to moderate water flow. 
Nest sites tended to have deeper water and steeper riverbanks compared to non-nesting sites. 
Fine substrates such as clay and silt were more common at nesting areas, while non-nesting sites often had coarser materials.
 Flow velocity was observed to be the most influential factor affecting where nests were built.
