<h2>Hydrodynamic Controls on Nest Site Selection of Janitor
Fish in Marikina River</h2>
<h3>Title One – Recommendations</h3>
<p>
Riverbank management strategies should be improved to reduce erosion caused by Janitor fish burrowing. Monitoring and control programs should be implemented in areas with high nesting activity.
 Riverbank modifications may be considered to make habitats less suitable for nesting in critical areas. Further studies should examine seasonal changes and flooding effects on nest survival.
