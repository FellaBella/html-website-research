<h2>AgroSentinel: A Hybrid Bio-Robotic and Environmental Sensing System for 
Enhancing Typhoon Resilience in Rice Production</h2>

<hr>

<h3>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Rice production in the Philippines is frequently disrupted by typhoons and flooding, resulting in reduced yields and crop losses.

	<li>Existing agricultural practices lack adaptive systems that can proactively respond to extreme weather conditions.

	<li>Although nature-based solutions show potential in improving agricultural resilience, their application is limited due to the absence of technology-supported and dynamic frameworks.

	<li>Smart sensing and automated agricultural systems remain mostly at the conceptual or pilot stage and are not widely implemented in real rice farming environments.

	<li>There is a lack of scalable hybrid bio-robotic systems that integrate biological responsiveness with robotic automation for environmental sensing in rice production.
