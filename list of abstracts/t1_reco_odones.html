<h2>AgroSentinel: A Hybrid Bio-Robotic and Environmental Sensing System for 
Enhancing Typhoon Resilience in Rice Production</h2>

<hr>

<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Future studies should conduct long-term field testing across different rice-growing locations to further validate the system’s reliability and durability.

	<li>Additional sensors, such as wind speed and water level sensors, may be integrated to improve weather prediction and flood monitoring capabilities.

	<li>The system may be enhanced by incorporating wireless data transmission or mobile application support for remote monitoring.

	<li>Further calibration and refinement of sensors are recommended to improve accuracy, particularly for rainfall detection.
