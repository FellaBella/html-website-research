<h2>Robo-Onion: An Innovative Sensor-based Forecasting System for Optimizing <i> Allium cepa L. </i> (Onion) Growth and Yield</h2>

<hr>

<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<h4>Robo-Onion has succesfully monitored all the growth and yield factors of <i>Allium cepa L.</i>, which include plant density, plant spacing, amount of water in the crops, temperature, and nutritional level.
</h4>
<h4>
Results of the paired t-test revealed statistically significant differences between sensor readings and manual measurements for temperature, amount of water, nutrional level, plant spacing, and plant density.
</h4>
<h4>
Accuracy assessment using percentage error indicated that the Robo-Onion sensors achieved an average accuracy rate of over 90% across all measured parameters. Response time analysis demonstrated that the system detected changes in environmental conditions within a short time frame, allowing timely data updates suitable for field monitoring.
</h4>
<h4>
Overall, the results indicate that Robo-Onion is a reliable and effective environmental monitoring tool capable of supporting rice farmers in making informed decisions related to the growth and yield factors </h4>
