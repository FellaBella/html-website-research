<h2>Waste Management Arduino-Based Robot Kinematics
that Utilize OV7607 Camera Sensor and
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</h2>
<hr>
<h3>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>The study aims to evaluate the performance of a robot with a camera sensor and image processing system 
in detecting and collecting different types of waste. It also seeks to assess how environmental conditions,
 physical obstacles, and weather affect the robot’s accuracy, speed, maximum reach, and waste-carrying capacity.</p>
