<h2>Development of Biodegradable Temperature-Responsive Wristbands Using 
Starch Films and Microencapsulated Thermochromic Leuco-dyes 
for Detecting Heat
</h2>

<h3>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Individuals react differently to certain heat levels, the creation of temperature-change visual signals can reduce risks that come with heat exposure.

	<li>Electronic devices, such as smart watches create e-waste, unlike temperature-responsive bioodegrable wristbands.
