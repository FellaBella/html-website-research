<h2>AgroSentinel: A Hybrid Bio-Robotic and Environmental Sensing System for 
Enhancing Typhoon Resilience in Rice Production</h2>

<hr>

<h3>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</h3>
<ol>
	<li>To develop an Arduino-based environmental monitoring system for rice farming.

	<li>To monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall in real time.

	<li>To help rice farmers prepare for and respond to typhoons using timely environmental data.

	<li>To test the accuracy and reliability of the system under different weather conditions.

	<li>To reduce crop losses and improve rice production through better monitoring and decision-making.
