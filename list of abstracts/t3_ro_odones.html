<h3>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</h3>
<ol>
<li>To develop a biodegrable, temperature-responsive wristband using starch films and microencapsulated thermochromic leuco-dyes for the purpose of detecting dangerous heat levels.

<li>To reduce risks related to heat exposure for individuals that react dangerously to a higher heat index.
