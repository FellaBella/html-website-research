<h3>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</h3>
<ol><li>The purpose of this research is to first develop a farmer-focused device capable of monitoring growth and yield factors of onions (<i>Allium cepa L.</i>), such as the water capacity of the plant, the temperature it is exposed to, and its rated nutritional level. Not only that, but process the factors including the space between each crop, and the density of the plants, while giving feedback and predicting the requirements needed to make the crop grow to its fullest potential.

<li>To assist farmers and to simply improve the onions (<i>Allium cepa L.</i>) crops harvested and food security.
