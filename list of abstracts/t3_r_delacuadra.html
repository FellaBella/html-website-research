<h2>EVALUATING PIPE CLOGGING CAUSED BYGREASE BUILDUP IN WASTEWATER DRAINAGE SYSTEMS</h2> 
<h3>Title Three – Results</h3>
<p>
The study found that grease buildup significantly contributes to pipe clogging in wastewater drainage systems. Pipes in kitchens, especially in restaurants, exhibited the highest levels of grease accumulation. 
After four weeks of observation, residential kitchen pipes showed an average grease thickness of 3 mm, reducing water flow by approximately 20%. 
In restaurant kitchens, the grease layer reached 7 mm, causing a flow reduction of around 55%, while commercial building pipes averaged 5 mm of grease buildup, leading to a 40% decrease in flow.
