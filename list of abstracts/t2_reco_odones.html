<h2>Robo-Onion: An Innovative Sensor-based Forecasting System for Optimizing <i> Allium cepa L. </i> (Onion) Growth and Yield</h2>

<hr>

<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Future studies should conduct long-term field testing across different rice-growing locations to further validate the system’s reliability and durability.

	<li>Additional sensors, such as wind speed and water level sensors, may be integrated to improve weather prediction and flood monitoring capabilities.

	<li>The system may be enhanced by incorporating wireless data transmission or mobile application support for remote monitoring.

	<li>Further calibration and refinement of sensors are recommended to improve accuracy, particularly for rainfall detection.
	
	<li>The adaptability of the device to different locations should be integrated.
