<h2>Robo-Onion: An Innovative Sensor-based Forecasting System for Optimizing <i> Allium cepa L. </i> (Onion) Growth and Yield</h2>

<hr>

<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
<h4>This study aims to develop the final model of Robo-Onion to be a working sensor-based device with a monitoring and forecasting system, designed specifically for onion (Allium cepa L.) and its growth and yield factors. The device will include sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature, and soil nutritional levels. These include a soil moisture sensor, DHT22 temperature sensor, soil nutrient sensor, connected to an Arduino Uno microcontroller that collects and processes all the data in real time.
<h4>Robo-Onion will have digital readings and analyzed results that show the current condition of the onion field. Based on the data it collects, the system will generate a forecast-based recommendation for water and nutrient requirements. Since the plant spacing and plant density have a manual input system, a keypad will be needed. Then, the system outputs information in a simple format, allowing farmers to identify whether the crops need watering, nutrient adjustment, etc. The feedback shall be displayed on an LCD in real-time.
</h4>
<h4>
The prototype will be built to operate continuously in a farm setting and demonstrate how engineering principles such as sensor integration, data processing, and system automation can be applied to improve agricultural decision-making. The main power source of the system will be from a rechargeable battery, however the use of solar panels are a possible future improvement. This final output serves as a practical and functional engineering solution that supports efficient onion crop management.
</h4>
<h4>
However, to test the accuracy of Robo-Onion compared to farmer observations, the study will use a paired t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the readings and analysis produced by Robo-Onion and the observations made by farmers under the same field conditions.
