<h2>Hydrodynamic Controls on Nest Site Selection of Janitor
Fish in Marikina River</h2>
<h3>Title One – Research Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>This study aims to determine how hydrodynamic factors such as flow velocity, water
depth, and shear stress influence the nest site selection of janitor fish in the Marikina River,
while also identifying which bank and substrate characteristics, including grain size, cohesion,
and slope, are associated with nesting locations. Additionally, the study aims to develop a simple
predictive model that can identify potential nesting zones along the river and provide science-
based recommendations for managing janitor-fish nesting activity and protecting riverbank
stability..</li>
