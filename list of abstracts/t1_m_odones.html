<h2>AgroSentinel: A Hybrid Bio-Robotic and Environmental Sensing System for 
Enhancing Typhoon Resilience in Rice Production</h2>

<hr>

<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
<h4>This study used an experimental research approach to evaluate the performance of AgroSentinel in monitoring environmental conditions affecting rice production. Data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall were collected at regular intervals and recorded using the system’s sensors and manual observation methods. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, while a paired t-test was applied to determine significant differences between sensor-generated and manually recorded measurements. Sensor accuracy was further assessed using mean absolute error and percentage error calculations. Response time and data consistency were analyzed through repeated measurements under varying environmental conditions. These analytical methods were used to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of AgroSentinel in supporting climate-resilient rice farming. <br><br><br>
The development of the Arduino based automated weather sensing system, 
AgroSentinel, involved the following key concepts: <br><br><br>
<ol><li>Hardware Components: The weather 
sensing system is built using Arduino-based components, including the Arduino Uno 
microcontroller, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, rain sensor, and soil 
moisture sensor. These sensors collect real-time environmental data connected to rice 
growth and weather changes. The data is displayed through a 16x2 LCD module and 
stored using a microSD card module for data analysis. A plastic enclosure is used to 
protect the parts of the device from outdoor conditions. <br><br><br> 
<li>Software Integration: The system operates using Arduino IDE programming, 
which allows sensor data to be processed and displayed in real time. The collected 
readings are logged in the microSD card for monitoring weather changes affecting rice 
production. Testing and Data Collection: The researchers will test the system in a rice 
field setup where environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and 
soil moisture will be recorded. Data gathered will be compared with manual observations 
to verify accuracy and consistency. Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the devices' 
system will be analyzed based on sensor accuracy and response time. The effectiveness 
of AgroSentinel will be determined by its ability to provide real-time weather information 
that helps improve rice field management and preparation for typhoon conditions. <ol></h4>
