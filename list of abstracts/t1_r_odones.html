<h2>AgroSentinel: A Hybrid Bio-Robotic and Environmental Sensing System for 
Enhancing Typhoon Resilience in Rice Production</h2>

<hr>

<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<h4>The AgroSentinel system successfully collected real-time data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall throughout the testing period. Descriptive statistical analysis showed that sensor-generated readings were generally consistent with manually recorded measurements across all environmental variables. The mean differences between sensor data and manual observations were minimal, indicating close agreement between the two data sources.
</h4>
<h4>
Results of the paired t-test revealed no statistically significant differences between sensor readings and manual measurements for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture (p > 0.05), suggesting that the system provided accurate and reliable environmental data. Rainfall detection showed slightly higher variation; however, the difference remained within acceptable error limits based on mean absolute error analysis.
</h4>
<h4>
Accuracy assessment using percentage error indicated that the AgroSentinel sensors achieved an average accuracy rate of over 90% across all measured parameters. Response time analysis demonstrated that the system detected changes in environmental conditions within a short time frame, allowing timely data updates suitable for field monitoring.
</h4>
<h4>
Overall, the results indicate that AgroSentinel is a reliable and effective environmental monitoring tool capable of supporting rice farmers in making informed decisions related to typhoon preparedness and field management. The system demonstrated strong potential for enhancing climate resilience in rice production through accessible and automated environmental sensing.</h4>
