<h2>A Study on Plastic Waste Accumulation in Rivers and Its Environmental Impact</h2> 
<hr>
<h3>Title Two – Results</h3>
<p>
The findings of the study revealed that most plastic waste in rivers originated from household garbage such as plastic bags, bottles, and food packaging. Areas located near residential communities showed a higher level of plastic waste accumulation compared to less populated areas. 
The study also found that improper waste disposal practices and limited awareness about waste management significantly contributed to river pollution, which negatively affected water quality and aquatic organisms.
