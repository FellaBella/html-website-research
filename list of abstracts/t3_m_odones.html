<h2>Development of Biodegradable Temperature-Responsive Wristbands Using 
Starch Films and Microencapsulated Thermochromic Leuco-dyes 
for Detecting Heat
</h2>

<hr>

<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
<h4>
First, cassava starch will be dissolved and mixed with glycerol to increase flexibility. Cassava starch will be used instead of corn starch to improve the film's elasticity because it contains more amylopectin. This will serve as the base for the wristband. The mixture will be put in molds. 
</h4>
<h4>

For the color-changing feature, microencapsulated thermochromic pigment will be mixed into the starch and glycerol. They’re designed to change color at 40°C, because the dye is protected inside the microcapsules, it can mix better in the film. To make the results more valid, a colorimeter will be used. This makes sure the test does not rely on human judgement as it may be subjective.
</h4>
<h4>

After drying, the wristbands have a chitosan solution applied to it that’s prepared with dilute acetic acid. This coating will protect against sweat and moisture while improving toughness and wearability, (Díaz-Cruz, et. Al., 2022). The prototypes will then be tested for temperature responsiveness and durability. 
</h4>
<h4>

The wristbands will be tested for temperature response using a colorimeter. 25 bracelets will be made using the final design. 5 wristbands will be placed inside a plastic bag and placed in a water that’s set to 37°C, 38°C, 40°C, 41°C, and 42°C using a thermometer. The color values of each wristband will be measured and compared starting from 37 °C to determine the color change.
</h4>
<h4>

A water-load system will be used to test ten wristbands in order to assess their durability. Each target weight, 0.25 kg, 0.50 kg, 0.75 kg, 1 kg, and 1.25 kg will have two wristbands. Every wristband will be tied to a bottle that is set on a scale on a fixed hook. Water will be added until the exact weights are achieved. The maximum weight will be reported if the bracelet fails before the target; if it holds, that level will be marked as passed. 
</h4>
<h4>

To check if the wristband can still respond accurately under sweat-like conditions, 25 wristbands will be used, similar to the temperature responsiveness test. 5 wristbands will be placed in an artificial sweat solution made of 0.5% NaCl and 0.1% lactic acid in distilled water for 15 minutes. After removing and gently drying them, the wristbands will be tested at 37°C, 38°C, 40°C, and 41°C using a colorimeter. Any visible damage to the starch or chitosan layer, such as swelling or peeling, will also be recorded.
</h4>
<h4>

In summary for the data analysis, basic statistical tests that fit the study’s design will be used. For the temperature responsiveness, the color responses will be compared with the rest a one-way ANOVA to see if the differences are significant. For durability, the average breaking force of the wristbands will be compared to the minimum using a one-sample t-test. The color values of the wristbands after sweat exposure will be compared with the color values of wristbands that were not exposed to sweat. A one-way ANOVA can be used to determine if the differences in color change at each target temperature.
