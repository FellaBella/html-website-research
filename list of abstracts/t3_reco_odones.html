<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Future studies should conduct sweat testing to ensure a more durable wristband

	<li>The wristabnd may further be enhanced through different materials and not just cassava starch, glycerin, chitosan, and thermochromic leuco-dyes.

	<li>More advanced testing materials should be used instead of the budget-friendly materials in the study.
	
	<li>The reusability of the device should be looked into and not just a one-time usage.
