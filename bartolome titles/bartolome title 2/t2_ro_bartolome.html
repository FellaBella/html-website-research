<h2>COMPARATIVE EVALUATION ON THE DURABILITY OF OPTIMIZED
EARTHENWARE CLAY-LATEX GLAZED POTS AND COMMERCIAL CLAY POTS</h2>
<hr>
<h3>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>To evaluate the durability and performance of optimized earthenware clay composite<br>
garden pots that are glazed with latex paint in comparison to traditional clay pots by<br>
analyzing their physical, mechanical, and environmental properties under various conditions,<br>
and to determine their feasibility and sustainability as an alternative gardening solution. </p>
